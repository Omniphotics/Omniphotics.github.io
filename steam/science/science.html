  Polarization refers to a specific way to filter out light. Light exibits behavior known
  as <i>wave-particle duality</i>, meaning that it has properties of both a particle and
  a wave. Light waves in varying directions, and polarizing filters allow us to only let
  through light that's waving in a specific direction. You can think of these as sine
  waves tilted at different angles, and a polarized filter only allows one tilt of sine
  wave to pass through. The less light that's let through, the darker it appears on the
  receiving side.

  Although light actually waves in many directions, it can be thought of as waving only
  horizontally and vertically. This creates the unique effect that when two polarized
  filters are held at right angles from one another, one will block horizontal light and
  the other will block vertical light, so in conjunction no light will be let through.
  Similarly, holding two polarized filters at 45&deg angles of one another will
  let through less light than what passes through just one filter, but not no light at all.
