<p id = "paragraph">
  Polarization refers to a specific way to filter out light. Light exibits behavior known
  as <i>wave-particle duality</i>, meaning that it has properties of both a particle and
  a wave. Light waves in varying directions, and polarizing filters allow us to only let
  through light that's waving in a specific direction. You can think of these as sine
  waves tilted at different angles, and a polarized filter only allows one tilt of sine
  wave to pass through. The less light that's let through, the darker it appears on the
  receiving side.
