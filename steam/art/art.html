      Like most modern products, Omniphotics have a comfortable and ergonomic design.
      While their main purpose is of course their adaptive lighting, The creative and
      less scientific parts of Omniphotics are just as important. Omniphotics are long
      and extend past the ear to prevent stress on the ear. The ends of the glasses
      are also specifically curved to create a more comfortable design. The sides that
      extend back are also very thin and lightweight to put less pressure on the ears
      and nose.

      Overall, the artistic elements of Omniphotics show in the comfortable and ergonomic
      design. They are glasses after all, and it would be an extreme oversight if they were
      uncomfortable. There was a lot of thought and care into making Omniphotics as comfortable
      and wearable as possible.
