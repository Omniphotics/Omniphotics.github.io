      Omniphotics features the design of common sunglasses. Simply put, there is no reason
      to reinvent the wheel. The magic in Omniphotics comes from the lenses, and there is
      no reason to modify the main structural design. Our team here at Omniphotics focused
      on designing what's important: the function. The sunglasses themselves are designed
      to be standard circular-lensed glasses.

    <p class="paragraph">
      In addition to our classic glasses design, Omniphotics has innovated and improved
      when it comes to the lenses. Standard sunglass lenses have a tint that darkens them
      and makes it easier to see in bright overwhelming light. This, however, is a static
      and unadaptive system. A slight improvement would be transition lenses, which
      automatically darken in bright light. Omniphotics, however, utilize a dual-polarization
      feature to dynamically ajust brightness at the user's will.
