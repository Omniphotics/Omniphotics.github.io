      Omniphotics features the design of common sunglasses. Simply put, there is no reason
      to reinvent the wheel. The magic in Omniphotics comes from the lenses, and there is
      no reason to modify the main structural design. Our team here at Omniphotics focused
      on designing what's important: the function. The sunglasses themselves are designed
      to be standard circular-lensed glasses.

    <p class="paragraph">
      In addition to our classic glasses design, Omniphotics has innovated and improved
      when it comes to the lenses. Standard sunglass lenses have a tint that darkens them
      and makes it easier to see in bright overwhelming light. This, however, is a static
      and unadaptive system. A slight improvement would be transition lenses, which
      automatically darken in bright light. Omniphotics, however, utilize a dual-polarization
      feature to dynamically ajust brightness at the user's will.

      The polarized filters slip into a thin plastic ring with rims to hold them in place.
      The polarized filters are held in place by the edges of the plastic rims, which wrap
      overtop of the edges of the polarized filters. One of the lenses is glued in place,
      and the other is free to rotate freely. To rotate the filter, the lense has
      a small extrusion near the rim like so:

      The wearer will press their finger against the small extrusion and move their finger
      in a circle to rotate the lense. This will adjust the brightness to the user's
      preference.
