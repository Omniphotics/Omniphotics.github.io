    <p class="paragraph">
      As we all know, light can be modeled as both a particle and a wave. For the purposes
      of understanding polarization, it's more useful to think of it as a wave. Specifically,
      we can treat light as a cosine wave. A horiztonally polarized light wave can be
      represented by a matrix with the following <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components:
    </p>

    <img src="images/matrix.png" class="matrix">

    <p class="paragraph">
      The x-component being the standard cosine function with amplitude <i>A<sub>x</sub></i>,
      frequency <i>f<sub>x</sub></i>, and phase shift &Phi;<sub>x</sub>, and the
      <i>y</i>-component being 0. Similarly, you can represent vertically polarized light as
      so:
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      In quantum mechanics, we often represent this using what's called "Bra-ket" notation,
      a system that uses "bras" (denoted by "&#10092; &#10072") and "kets" (denoted by
      "&#10072 &#10093;")
      to denote a vector in an abstract vector space, and to represent the state of a quantum
      system. The two vectors above would be written as:
    </p>

    <img src="images/braket.png" class="matrix">
    <img src="images/braket2.png" class="matrix">

    <p class="paragraph">
      With the functions next to the kets representing the component of the vector in that
      direction. These waves can also be added together to create a diagonal wave:
    </p>

    <img src="images/diagonal-wave.png" class="matrix">

    <p class="paragraph">
      Note that the waves have no phase shift or amplitude for this. This would create a perfect diagonal
      vector along the <i>y</i> = <i>x</i> line. Giving the two vectors different phase shifts
      would create different shapes and types of polarization. Adding different amplitudes
      would create a diagonal vector that is <i>not</i> along the <i>y</i> = <i>x</i> line,
      and adding different phase shifts could instead create an ellipse. If you have two
      waves which have the same amplitude but phase shifts that are 90&deg (&pi;/2 rad) apart,
      they will trace out a circle, creating what is known as "circularly polarized light":
    </p>

    <img src="images/circular-polarization.png" class="matrix">

    <p class="paragraph">
      Of course these again have to have equal amplitudes, because that determines the magnitude
      of the vector and thus the radius of the circle. These cosine functions can also be
      represented with a complex number:
    </p>

    <img src="images/complex.png" class="matrix" style="width: 35vw; height: auto;">

    <p class="paragraph">
      Of course, this should be fairly intuitive if you understand the relationship between
      waves and complex numbers. In a sense, all of these representations are different
      ways of conveying the same idea: wrapping two numbers together. A two dimensional
      matrix, a two dimensional vector, a complex number, and a cosine wave all show
      two numbers in conjunction with one another. The case of the cosine wave is a bit
      more obscure, but it comes in the form of the amplitude and phase shift.
