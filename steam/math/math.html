    <p id="intro-paragraph">
      Before starting this section, I wanted to preface with a breif introduction and
      disclaimer. The math behind Omniphotics gets pretty intense, and I'm going to dive
      deep into analyzing quantum mechanical situations from a mathematical perspective.
      To understand these explanations in full requires prerequisites such as college-level
      math and physics. I don't exactly have the time to give you a full course on either
      of those, so I'm just going to give you information that's directly relevent to
      Omniphotics, and I apologize if any of it is difficult to understand.

    <p class="laaw-paragraph">
      As we all know, light can be modeled as both a particle and a wave. For the purposes
      of understanding polarization, it's more useful to think of it as a wave. Specifically,
      we can treat light as a cosine wave. A horiztonally polarized light wave can be
      represented by a matrix with the following <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components:
    </p>

    <img src="images/matrix.png" class="matrix">

    <p class="laaw-paragraph">
      The x-component being the standard cosine function with amplitude <i>A<sub>x</sub></i>,
      frequency <i>f<sub>x</sub></i>, and phase shift &Phi;<sub>x</sub>, and the
      <i>y</i>-component being 0. Similarly, you can represent vertically polarized light as
      so:
    </p>

    <p class="laaw-paragraph">
      In quantum mechanics, we often represent this using what's called "Bra-ket" notation,
      a system that uses "bras" (denoted by "&#10092; &#10072") and "kets" (denoted by
      "&#10072 &#10093;")
      to denote a vector in an abstract vector space, and to represent the state of a quantum
      system. The two vectors above would be written as:
    </p>

    <img src="images/braket.png" class="matrix">
    <img src="images/braket2.png" class="matrix">

    <p class="laaw-paragraph">
      With the functions next to the kets representing the component of the vector in that
      direction. These waves can also be added together to create a diagonal wave:
    </p>

    <img src="images/diagonal-wave.png" class="matrix">

    <p class="laaw-paragraph">
      Note that the waves have no phase shift or amplitude for this. This would create a perfect diagonal
      vector along the <i>y</i> = <i>x</i> line. Giving the two vectors different phase shifts
      would create different shapes and types of polarization. Adding different amplitudes
      would create a diagonal vector that is <i>not</i> along the <i>y</i> = <i>x</i> line,
      and adding different phase shifts could instead create an ellipse. If you have two
      waves which have the same amplitude but phase shifts that are 90&deg (&pi;/2 rad) apart,
      they will trace out a circle, creating what is known as "circularly polarized light":
    </p>

    <p class="laaw-paragraph">
      Of course these again have to have equal amplitudes, because that determines the magnitude
      of the vector and thus the radius of the circle. These cosine functions can also be
      represented with a complex number:
