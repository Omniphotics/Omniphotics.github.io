    <p class="paragraph">
      Have you ever worn sunglasses while having to go back and forth between indoors and
      outdoors? If you have, you’ll know that it's hard to see inside because of how dark
      they are. Your only solution to this would be to take them off every time you walk
      inside and put them back on everytime you walk outside. It’s a hassle, and needs to
      be fixed. Omniphotics are the solution. Omniphotics provide you with dynamically
      adaptive lighting based on the user’s preference. The wearer is able to rotate the
      lenses to create a darker or lighter tint depending on what they want. This would
      prevent people from having to switch glasses or keep removing and wearing them. The
      name Omniphotics comes from the root omni meaning “all” and photic meaning “light”,
      because these are truly designed to cover a wide range of light levels. Omniphotics
      utilize a simple and sleek design to give wearers function and fashion. They’re
      meant to be comfortable and useful, and keep not only your head comfortable, but
      your eyes too. Omniphotics innovate scientifically, technologically, artistically,
      and mathematically to provide users with an amazing experience.

      Omniphotics was a project that would not have been possible without lots of help
      from various online sources and explanations. Below I have included links and descriptions
      to all of the places I found my information.
