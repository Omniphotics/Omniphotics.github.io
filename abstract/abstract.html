    <p class="header">What are Omniphotics?</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Have you ever worn sunglasses while having to go back and forth between indoors and
      outdoors? If you have, you’ll know that it's hard to see inside because of how dark
      they are. Your only solution to this would be to take them off every time you walk
      inside and put them back on everytime you walk outside. It’s a hassle, and needs to
      be fixed. Omniphotics are the solution. Omniphotics provide you with dynamically
      adaptive lighting based on the user’s preference. The wearer is able to rotate the
      lenses to create a darker or lighter tint depending on what they want. This would
      prevent people from having to switch glasses or keep removing and wearing them. The
      name Omniphotics comes from the root omni meaning “all” and photic meaning “light”,
      because these are truly designed to cover a wide range of light levels. Omniphotics
      utilize a simple and sleek design to give wearers function and fashion. They’re
      meant to be comfortable and useful, and keep not only your head comfortable, but
      your eyes too. Omniphotics innovate scientifically, technologically, artistically,
      and mathematically to provide users with an amazing experience.

      Omniphotics was a project that would not have been possible without lots of help
      from various online sources and explanations. Below I have included links and descriptions
      to all of the places I found my information. You can click the titles of the sources to
      be redirected straight to them.

      "Bell's Theorem: The Quantum Venn Diagram Paradox" video by minutephysics and 3Blue1Brown</a>

    <p class="paragraph" style="margin-top: 1vw;">
      This video by YouTube channels minutephysics and 3Blue1Brown was the inspiration behind
      Omniphotics. In the beginning of the video they show the base tech behind Omniphotics,
      and explain a lot of the light physics. The video goes more in depth into the quantum
      mechanics and bizarre nature of photons. It's a fantastic watch and serves as the
      backbone for the science, technology, and inspiration behind Omniphotics.
